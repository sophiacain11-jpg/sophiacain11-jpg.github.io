# Sophia's Portfolio

Welcome!

I’m a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Master’s in International Relations, with a concentration in Data Science for Policy and a minor in International Finance and Economic Policy. This portfolio showcases Python-based projects where I combine foreign policy analysis with data-driven methods. I learn best by building and experimenting with real-world data.
